### Notable Projects

#### Dynamic Hedging - Binomial Pricing Model | 3Blue1Brown's Summer of Math Exposition

The following <a href="https://youtu.be/s5EXkS4iDxk">video</a> was created for <a href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/blog/some1"> 3Blue1Brown's SoME</a>.
The <a href="https://github.com/gabrielyiu1998/DynamicHedging">code</a> uploaded on github helped produce the numbers and visualizations shown in my video.

The gif below is from the 2nd backtesting part of the <a href="https://youtu.be/TwChigDDG5U"> video</a>
where I backtest my dynamic hedging strategy during the March 2020 market crash.

#### Risk Lab 2019 Case Competition University of Toronto (1st Place!)

The following <a href="https://github.com/gabrielyiu1998/RiskLabCompetition/blob/main/Final_presentation.pdf">presentation</a> is the deck we presented
for our case competition. We were tasked with analyzing market risk, liquidity risk, and credit risk for 20 companies. We needed to construct an
ETF portfolio using the 20 stocks that was not overly exposed to the risks above. The <a href="https://github.com/gabrielyiu1998/RiskLabCompetition">R code</a>
uploaded helped us with our stepwise regressions, VaR, and ES calculations.

#### Mathematical Modelling Final Project

This was my <a href="https://github.com/gabrielyiu1998/APM348_OR_Proj/blob/main/APM348Final%20report%20-%20(Jan%2013%2C%202021).pdf">final project</a>
for APM348 at University of Toronto. My team developed formulated an ice-cream production procedure
as a Markov Decision Process. We used reinforcement learning techniques (Q-Learning) to solve the model.
